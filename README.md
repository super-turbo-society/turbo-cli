Turbo is a game engine built for making games fast.

## Features

- **Every platform**: Turbo uses WebAssembly + WebGPU, so it can run anywhere!
- **Prevent cheating**: Turbo games can run headlessly so you can verify game
  state on remote servers.
- **Never close your game window**: games hot-reload whenever code, shaders, or
  sprites are modifed.
- **Noob-friendly**: Turbo's built-in APIs are aimed to help you do cool things
  with minimal lines of code.
