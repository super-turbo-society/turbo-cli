Turbo is a game engine built for making games fast.

## Features

- Every platform -- Turbo uses WebAssembly + WebGPU, so it can run anywhere!
- Prevent cheating -- Turbo games can run headlessly so you can verify game
  state on remote servers.
- Never close your game window -- games hot-reload whenever code, shaders, or
  sprites are modifed.
- Noob-friendly -- Turbo's built-in APIs are aimed to help you do cool things
  with minimal lines of code.
